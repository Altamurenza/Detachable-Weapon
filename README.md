# Detachable-Weapon
Imagine how could you possibly drop a baseball bat, but you could not do it to Spud Gun? Why?!
This mod aimed to expand the mechanism of all storable weapons in your inventory, so now you can lose all your weapons. You can get them again by buying them from several shops or looting them from some knocked out NPC if you're lucky enough.

Features:
- Player can detach the undetachable weapons like Fire Cracker, Slingshot, Spud Gun, Rocket Launcher, etc.
- Player & NPC can disarm any undetachable weapon from others with a grapple or shoot.
- Player & NPC can loot from knocked out characters.
- Brand new fireworks stores & camera stores across the map. (4 new stores added in total)
